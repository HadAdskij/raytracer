Simple Raytracer
================

This is a very simple raytracer I did, when I was beggining to study
some computer graphics. It is capable of displaying only some simple
shapes (planes, spheres and infinite cylinders) with basic Phong shading.
It also supports glass surfaces that only refract light rays.

Building
--------
Building should be easy in Windows/Linux and should not work out of the
box for OS X because of path differences for OpenGL, but this can be
easily fixed. Just build the CMake file on the root directory.
